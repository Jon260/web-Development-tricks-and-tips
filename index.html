        <h1>log in</h1>
        <p>Logging in is such a staple of modern digital life, right? Most often, it involves entering your username and password to access your account on a website or an app. It's your first line of security for keeping your personal data safe. But did you know there are several ways to enhance your login security, like using multi-factor authentication (MFA)? This adds an extra layer of security by requiring a second form of verification beyond just your password.</p>
